        <h2><b>Insruction</b></h2>
        <p>Lie on your stomach, arms by your side, your forehead or your chin on the mat.<br>
            Lengthen your lower back by gently pressing your pubic bone into the floor, and pull your navel in towards the spine as you exhale.
            <br>Engage your leg muscles.
            <br>As you inhale, lift your head, chest, arms and legs off the floor, firming your shoulder blades onto your back, and so broadening your chest.
            <br> You can imagine someone holding your hands gently pulling you back, to come up higher.
            <br>Feet are drawn towards the mid-line but do not have to be touching, you can keep them hip-width apart.
            <br>Stay for 5 breaths making sure breathing remains calm and steady.
            <br>As you exhale, lower out of the pose then repeat another two times.
            <br>Rest in between each pose by making a pillow for your cheek with your arms and letting your heels drop away from each other.</p><hr>
